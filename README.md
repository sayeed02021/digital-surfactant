# Understanding Generative Model Performance in Property-Guided Surfactant Design: A Comparative Study on Diffusion and Transformer Models
This repository contains the implementation of our work. 

## Instructions for running the codes in the repository:
Clone into repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sayeed02021/digital-surfactant.git

cd digital-surfactant
```

## Diffusion 
The [diffusion README](./diffusion/README.md) contains instructions for training the diffusion models described our work and generating new molecules.

## Transformer
The [transformer README](./transformer/README.md) contains instructions for training the transformer models described in our work and generating new molecules.

## Property Predictor Models
The [prop-pred README](/prop_pred/README.md) contains instructions for training the property predictor models.
